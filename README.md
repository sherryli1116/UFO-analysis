# UFO-analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
We want to help Dana to create the full webpage containing not just information about UFOs, but she wants us to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by adding the filter colomns for readers to apply multiple criteria at the same time. Dana wants us to add city, state, county and shape for table filters on the webpage. By using javascript to edit the code we previously had, we want to create a webpage that is able to satisfy multiple criterias in the end.
## Results

From the webpage we created, we can see that the filter search function is on the left side which includes date, city, state, country and shape filters. If we choose to filter out triangle shape, we can simply type it in the shape filter, and on the right we will see all UFO sightings that match this criteria. If we want to change criterias, we can simply just type our requirements in the filter boxes and type enter to proceed. The result will show on the right as well.
## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
It seems like the data we included in the webpage contains only UFO sighting is the U.S. Therefore, it is not necessary to set a country filter in this case because we do not have any other countries to filter out. In addition, we can change one of the filter to duration. We can also separate each sections on the webpage using more obvious titles, so the readers can have a better experience in gathering the information they need.
